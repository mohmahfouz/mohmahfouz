Hi, I am Mohamed, a Data Analyst who loves investigating datasets to gain useful insights. I've recently analyzed the A/B testing results of a new landing page for an e-commerce company. I'd love to combine my passion for data science with skills in Python, SQL, Inferential statistics, and Tableau to continue gaining insights to support decision-making for businesses.
