Hi there, I'm Mohamed, a Data Scientist, and a Python Programmer. I love building models to gain insights from data that lets stakeholders take the right business decisions. I recently developed a Jupyter notebook to predict demand using AutoML.
I also love writing scripts that automate data extraction using Scrapy, Selenium, and playwright.
